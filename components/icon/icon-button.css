/* NOTE: 
  (1) Using a CSS file to apply these Tailwind classes because this approach allows other components
      to override these utility classes (whereas applying them directly to the HTML does not allow
      overriding unless the overriding classes happen to be defined later in the Tailwind's source).
  (2) I had to use a regular CSS file (not a bla.module.css file) because using the module CSS 
      approach does not work with the `group-hover:` classes.  That's why I made the class name
      more-verbose (using BEM), since I think this class will have global scope.
