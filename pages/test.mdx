import Button from "components/fake-button";

# About

This is a paragraph

## another header

and text [^1] (There should be a superscript before this, indicating a footnote)

<Button text="yo, click me" />

This is a sentence with a piece of code like `thisThing.tsx`.

This is a normal paragraph with some ~crossed out text here~. Or I can use double tilde to cross ~~like this~~.

Here is a table (since I have the GitHub flavored markdown extension installed)
| a | b | c | d |
| - | :- | -: | :-: |

And this is a task list:

- [ ] to do
- [x] this one is done

```tsx
export default function someFunction() {
  return 12;
}
```

[^1]: this is a footnote to explain something.
